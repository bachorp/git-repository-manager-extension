Have you ever experienced any of these things:
- Finding a repository in your local spends a lot of your time because you don't know where you place it.
- Want to clone a repository but it already has the same name.

Git Repository Manager VS Code extension is to help you manage your git repositories easier. 

After cloning repositories, you will get the following structure:

```bash
~/Code
├── github.com
|  └── vscode
|     └── extensions-sample
└── gitlab.com
   └── test
      ├── hello-world
      └── react
```

The structure includes three git repositories:

- `git@github.com:vscode/extensions-sample.git`
- `git@gitlab.com:test/hello-world.git`
- `git@gitlab.com:test/react.git`

The repository folder name is generated by the domain, group, project in your git repository url.

This extension is inspired by [projj](https://github.com/popomore/projj).
